# 💻 My Time at the 2025 US Cyber Games

June 2025

I just finished competing in the 2025 US Cyber Games, and wow, what an experience. It was a huge learning opportunity and one of the most exciting things I've done in my cybersecurity journey.
## 🧠 Learning by Doing

The US Cyber Games is a nationwide CTF where tons of people test their skills. For a few days, I was completely absorbed in solving challenges. It was tough, fun, and showed me just how much there is to learn in the cyber world.
## 🏆 How I Did and What I Learned

I was really happy to finish 63rd overall!

I managed to complete all the challenges in the Forensics and Misc categories, which felt awesome. I also made good progress in the Web and Crypto sections.

But the competition also showed me what I need to work on. The pwn and Reverse Engineering challenges were super tough, and it’s clear I need more experience there. Honestly, one of the best parts was all the new tools I got to use. I was constantly learning how to use new software on the fly to solve problems.
## 🛠️ Technical Write-ups & Code

For those interested in the technical details, I'm publishing my write-ups for the challenges on GitHub. You can see exactly how I solved problems in Forensics, Misc, and the other categories. It’s the best way to see the tools and techniques I used in action.

## 💬 What's Next?

The US Cyber Games was a great reality check. It reminded me that in cybersecurity, you never stop learning. I’m proud of how I did, but this is just the beginning.

Now I know exactly what I need to study. I’m excited to get better at the hard stuff and improve my hands-on skills.

The game is far from over.

Onward.
